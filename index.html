My name is Stephanie, I am a 26 year old mom that was born & raised in Little Village, Chicago. I am an adminstartive assistant at a dental office and I also do nail art part time. I originally became intrigued with coding during the Myspace era. Since then, I have dabbled in many different forms of web design and content. I decided to make this career change in 2020 after the pandemic hit and I was left with many uncertainties one of which was job security. Because of this I started looking into different fields that would combine my admiration for tech and design while ensuring a good income. Although I do not have an elaborate portfolio to share, your experience on my web page is inteded to show case what I've learned thus far in the bootcamp. I am 100% open to feedback, so please, all is welcome!
